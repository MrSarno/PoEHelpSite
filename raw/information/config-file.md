> Where to find Path of Exile's production_Config.ini file

The `production_Config.ini` file stores various game client settings, and manually editing it can help resolve various issues. Renaming or deleting the file can help if you suspect it has become damaged by data corruption.

<caution>

Never manually edit, delete, rename, or move this file while the game client is running.
