#### Download and install HWMonitor

<tip>

Ensure you click on the `SETUP Â· ENGLISH` button on the left; not the `TRY HWMONITOR PRO !` button on the right.

</tip>

The final step of the setup wizard offers to display a `hwm_readme.txt`. You can untick this or just close it after it opens.

#### Grant HWMonitor elevated privileges if requested

<note>

HWMonitor may require additional permissions to access temperature readings and the like. This is normal.

</note>

#### Run HWMonitor in the background while you play

When you're finished gaming, either look at the temperature values yourself, or [Create a Thread in Technical Support](/miscellaneous/other/create-a-thread-in-technical-support) and show us screenshots of its output.
