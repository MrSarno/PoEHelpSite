# Connect Your Monitor to the Video Card

> Force your desktop to always use your more powerful graphics card

<note>

If using a laptop, instead see [Set Windows To Use Your Video Card](/miscellaneous/other/set-windows-to-video-card).

</note>

Sometimes issues with FPS in Path of Exile are caused by the game running on your CPU's integrated graphics instead of the more powerful video card.

For desktops, the simplest solution is to disconnect your monitor from your motherboard, and connect it directly to your video card.
