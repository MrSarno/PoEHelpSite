# Client Crashes

> Guidance for troubleshooting the client crashing to the Desktop

<tip>

While troubleshooting is often effective, some crashes may require that GGG release a fix in an update.

#### Verify your game client's files

The first step in troubleshooting crashes is [Repairing Your Client](/miscellaneous/other/repair-the-client).

#### Try using a different Graphics API

The Windows client allows you to choose between the `DirectX 11`, `DirectX 12`, and `Vulkan` renderers. Test all three.

<warning>

The macOS client does not presently include this setting.

</warning>

#### Ask the community to review your log file

Wait for the game client to crash one more time. Then, without running the game again, [Create a Thread in Technical Support](/miscellaneous/other/create-a-thread-in-technical-support) and be sure to include [Your LatestClient.txt](/information/log-file) file. Please also provide your [System Information](/information/system-info).

#### Reinstall Path of Exile

If all else fails, you may need to uninstall the game and perform a fresh download and install.
