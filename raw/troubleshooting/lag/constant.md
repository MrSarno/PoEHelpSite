# Constant High Ping

> Troubleshooting a stable latency value that is unusually high

<note>

Refer to the [Latency Spikes](/troubleshooting/lag/spikes) page unless your latency is very stable.

</note>

Most issues with your ping to a game server will result in the ping being sporadic and inconsistent. If your ping is high, but is not fluctuating, that eliminates many possible causes of connectivity problems.

Troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds can be found below.

<steps level="4">

#### Double-check which gateway you are connected to

<note>

If your preferred gateway has reached capacity, you will be offloaded to a different gateway.

</note>

#### Turn off any VPNs running on your computer

<tip>

Use of a VPN will almost always result in having a less direct connection from your computer to the game server.

</tip>

#### Check your router for any enabled Quality of Service features

Try turning off [Quality of Service](/miscellaneous/other/quality-of-service) if it is active on your router.

#### Analyse your connection to the Path of Exile server

Examine your [Server Connection](/information/server-connection) for signs of a problem.
