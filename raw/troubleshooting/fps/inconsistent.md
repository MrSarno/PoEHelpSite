# Sharp FPS Drops

> Troubleshooting particularly severe FPS drops, such as when in combat

<steps level="4">

#### Overheating

The top priority is to [Check for Overheating](/miscellaneous/other/check-for-overheating).

#### Disable vibrations if using a controller

[Turn Off the Vibration Setting](/miscellaneous/other/turn-off-vibration-setting) as it introduces severe stutter.

#### Ensure the game isn't running on your CPU's integrated graphics

<note>

This advice only applies to desktops running a Windows Operating System.

</note>

[Connect Your Monitor to the Video Card](/miscellaneous/other/connect-monitor-to-video-card) directly for the best possible FPS

#### Configure Windows to run Path of Exile using your more powerful video card

<note>

This advice only applies to computers running a Windows OS, and is specifically recommended for laptop owners.

</note>

[Set Windows To Use Your Video Card](/miscellaneous/other/set-windows-to-video-card) instead of your CPU's integrated graphics adapter

#### Check for programs performing updates

Pause any [Background Downloads](/miscellaneous/other/background-downloads) as they may cause a performance bottleneck.

#### Turn off your web browser's hardware acceleration

If playing a video or livestream in the background, turn off [Hardware Acceleration](/miscellaneous/other/hardware-acceleration) in your browser.

#### Turn off `Vertical Sync` in Path of Exile's options menu

#### Lower your graphics settings in Path of Exile

If you'd like specific suggestions, gather your [System Information](/information/system-info) and [Create a Thread in Technical Support](/miscellaneous/other/create-a-thread-in-technical-support).
