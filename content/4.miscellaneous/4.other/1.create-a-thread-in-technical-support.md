The more information you include in your post, the quicker and easier it will be for others to help you.

You should _always_ include at least the following information;
- Whether the issue is with Path of Exile 1 or Path of Exile 
- An overview of the problem
- If you are getting an error message, either quote **all** of it or provide a screenshot
- Are you playing on Windows, macOS, Linux, Xbox, or PlayStation?
- If using a desktop or laptop, clarify which client you use (Steam / standalone / Epic Games Store)
