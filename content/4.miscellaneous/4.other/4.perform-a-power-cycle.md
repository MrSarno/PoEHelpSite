A very common troubleshooting step is to power cycle your modem and router.

This purges their caches, causes them to re-establish a connection to your ISP, and reinitialises their configuration.

Power cycling your modem and router allows them to reset and re-establish a connection to your ISP. Follow these steps to completely power cycle the devices in your network connection:

::tip
If your device has a battery, use the device's Reset button or temporarily remove the battery.
::

- Power off all devices connected to the router
- Power off the router
- If you have both a router and a modem, power off the modem
- Wait for 60 seconds
- Power on the modem
- Power on the router
- Power on your other devices
