This permissions-based error can crop up late in the process of patching your client.

Look for a `PathOfExile.tmp` file. If you can find one, delete the PathOfExile.exe file and rename the other file to "PathOfExile.exe".

::note
Typically, the above workaround allows the patch process to continue with no further problems.
