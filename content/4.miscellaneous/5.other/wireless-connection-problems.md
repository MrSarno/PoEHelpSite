Using WiFi, phone hotspots, and satellite connections should be avoided at all possible.

The lack of shielding afforded to such internet traffic makes problems such as latency spikes, packet loss, and congestion much worse than they otherwise would be. Therefore, the use of an Ethernet cable to connect your device directly to the router is **strongly** recommended.

In order of preference;

- Wired connections where devices are plugged directly into the router using an Ethernet cable are optimal
- Powerline Adapter Kits and WiFi solutions are about equally reliable - and which is best for you can change over time 
- Mobile hotspots will be more inconsistent than WiFi in almost all situations
- Satellite connections can involve severe latency values and are not suitable for online gaming

## Troubleshooting

In cases where it simply isn't possible to use an Ethernet cable, please see below.

::steps{level="4"}
#### Move your desktop, laptop, handheld, or console closer to your router if at all possible
#### Try to avoid large (and particularly electrical) obstructions
#### See if changing to a different wireless channel improves stability
#### Try power cycline your network devices
