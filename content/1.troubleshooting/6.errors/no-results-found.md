  description: An error message sometimes seen in the in-game market.

This error message seems to exclusively appear if you try accessing the in-game market while playing in an SSF league.

SSF (Solo, Self-Found) is an optional challenge mode designed to increase difficulty and associated bragging rights.

To access the in-game market to conduct trades with other players, you will need to migrate out of the SSF league.
