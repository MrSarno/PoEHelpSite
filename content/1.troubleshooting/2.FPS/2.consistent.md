::tip
Test your in-game performance after trying each of the steps listed below.
::

::steps{level="4"}
#### Enable `Triple Buffering`
#### Disable `Vertical Sync`
This can be found in the `Graphics` tab of the game's options, where it is called `VSync`.
#### Check your `Foreground FPS` setting
#### Configure your Operating System's CPU power management
::note
This article is specific to Windows Operating Systems and does not have a clear macOS analogue.
::
Set your [Processor Power Management](/miscellaneous/other/processor-power-management) to never reduce your CPU's state below 100%.
#### Check your `Background FPS` setting
::tip
This shouldn't relevant while you are playing, but in case of possible bugs it's worth changing the setting.
::
#### Check whether any frame limiting-software is running
Tools such as AMD Radeon Chill, NVIDIA Control Panel, and RivaTuner can potentially impose FPS caps.
#### Disable any Adaptive Sync features
For testing purposes, try disabling G-Sync or FreeSync.
#### Check whether Windows has reset your monitor's refresh rate as part of a recent update
If your high refresh rate monitor has been capped to 60 Hz, your FPS may seem lower than you are used to.
